# Dainty – One Dark Pro

This is a slightly modified version of One Dark Pro that comes in 25 variations of different chroma and lightness levels.

The theme has been imported into [Dainty for Visual Studio Code](https://dainty.site/vscode) as a preset. The colors have then been processed within the Lab color space, and exported to several variations.
